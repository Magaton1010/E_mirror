Analog Clock using SVG and JavaScript
This HTML document creates a simple analog clock using Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) and JavaScript. It also includes PHP code to generate the tick marks and hour numbers on the clock face.

HTML Structure:
The page starts with the <!DOCTYPE html> declaration and includes the <html>, <head>, and <body> elements.
CSS styles in the <style> section define the appearance of the clock.
The background color of the body is set to black (background-color: #000000;).
The clock container (clock-container) is set to have a fixed width and height of 200px.
SVG Clock:
Inside the clock container (<div class="clock-container">), there's an SVG element (<svg>) with a width and height of 200px.
The SVG element contains a circle representing the clock face with a radius of 95 and a stroke color of white (#FCFCFF).
Tick Marks and Hour Numbers:
PHP code is used to generate the tick marks for every minute and the hour numbers on the clock face.
The tick marks are created using <line> elements with varying lengths and thicknesses.
The hour numbers are placed at appropriate positions using <text> elements, which show the numbers 1 to 12.
JavaScript:
The script at the end of the HTML page defines a function updateClock(timezone) to update the clock's hands (hour, minute, and second) based on the current time in the specified timezone.
The function calculates the angles of the clock hands based on the current hour, minute, and second.
The hands are represented by <line> elements with the classes .hour-hand, .minute-hand, and .second-hand.
The setInterval() function is used to call updateClock(timezone) every second to keep the clock updated with the current time.
Timezone Usage:
The initial usage of the updateClock() function sets the timezone to "Asia/Tehran" to display the clock time in Tehran's timezone.
The clock is updated every second for Tehran's timezone.
Overall, this code creates an analog clock that displays the current time in the specified timezone (Tehran's timezone in this case). The clock is designed using SVG graphics, and the JavaScript function continuously updates the clock hands to show the current time. The PHP code is used to generate the tick marks and hour numbers on the clock face.# E_mirror
